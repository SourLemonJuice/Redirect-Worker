# Redirect-Worker

A CloudFlare Worker for redirecting requests

Also my first `.js`

I hate Prettier... Why can't we keep the line breaks?(after single if())

## Usage

The configuration part is `const redirect_tree = {}`.\
It defines a tree of routing structures

Don't add any `/` after the router path
